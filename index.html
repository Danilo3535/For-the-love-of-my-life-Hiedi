    <p class="long-text">
        From the very first day we talked, you made me realize that maybe life isn’t entirely made of gray days and painful memories.
        You showed me that after so many years of trauma, I could truly enjoy life again — especially with someone as special as you.
        <br><br>
        YOU are everything I could ever ask for from this world, and most of all from God.
        You are the most beautiful, gentle, funny, and caring girlfriend, and that alone makes me incredibly happy.
        <br><br>
        I hope I am the only boy in your eyes, and that no one will ever take you away from me.
        I love you, and I will love you until my very last days on this earth.
        <br><br>
        <strong>P.S.</strong> I cried for about 15 minutes while writing this — that’s how IMPORTANT you are to me. ❤️
